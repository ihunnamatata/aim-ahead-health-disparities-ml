# AIM-AHEAD Health Disparities ML (Simulated Demo)

This project replicates the structure and analysis of a real AIM-AHEAD/NCATS ML study on health disparities in COVID-19 mortality among cardiovascular patients. The original research was conducted on secure, real-world electronic health record (EHR) data housed within the NCATS N3C enclave and presented at the AIM-AHEAD AI4Equity Symposium.

⚠️ **This public repository uses fully synthetic data for demonstration purposes only.** No real patient data is included here.

## Project Overview

- Predict COVID-19 mortality using ML models (logistic regression, random forest)
- Analyze impact of race, sex, vaccination status, and age on outcomes
- Balance classes using SMOTE
- Visualize disparities and feature importance
- Includes a simple Streamlit demo for public interaction

---

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Or open `notebooks/disparities_model_v2.ipynb` to explore the code.
